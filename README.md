# ChicagoCrimes

This is our group project 3 for CIS 3200. This group consisted of work computed by Dylan Mora and Heang Chua. 
We have here our final tutorial sample and also our term paper. 
We have included the whole dataset URL, presentation copy and also the sample dataset for 2015, 2016 and 2017 individually. 
We also included graphs that were generated using Kibana.
